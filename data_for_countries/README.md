## Description
This is a very basic React app in which you search for a country, the country's data is accessed using two APIs, and the data is displayed.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate `data-for-countries`
3. `npm install`
4. `REACT_APP_API_KEY={API KEY} npm start` (need an API key from Open Weather API for weather, can run `npm start` for no weather)
